## **Project Objective**

To transcribe credit transcripts from universities, schools, and educational institutions, each in different formats. The sources include:

- Paper documents (readable and less readable).
- Scanned copies and digital files (PDF and images).
- API connections and databases (where possible).

## Proposed Technologies

### 1. Transcription and Automation Software
   - Aquarius AQ WEB and AQ FORMS:
     - Document storage and search.
     - Automated form design.
     - Digital signatures and customized workflows.
     - Cost: Includes licenses for users, cloud storage, and form design.
   - Specialized OCR (Optical Character Recognition):
     - Tools such as Amazon Textract to automate the reading of paper documents and digitize them.
     - Crucial for processing readable and semi-readable documents.
   - Data Extraction and Validation:
     - Custom algorithms to extract key data fields from structured and unstructured formats.
     - Validation mechanisms to ensure data accuracy.
   - API Integration:
     - Custom integration with databases and API systems where feasible.

### 2. Infrastructure and Services
   - Professional Scanners:
     - High-speed scanners to capture paper documents.
   - Cloud Platforms:
     - Secure storage on servers like AWS to handle large data volumes.

### 3. Personnel for Digitalization
   - Data Entry Operators:
     - Responsible for manual transcription of documents that are not suitable for automated processes.
     - Estimated 10 operators for a period of 12 months.
   - Quality Control Specialists:
     - Ensure accuracy by validating data through sampling and cross-review.
     - Estimated 5 specialists for 12 months.
   - Scanning Technicians:
     - Operate scanners and perform document preparation for digitalization.
     - Estimated 4 technicians for 12 months.
   - Project Coordinator:
     - Oversees the digitalization process, ensures deadlines are met, and manages personnel.
